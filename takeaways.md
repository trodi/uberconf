actionable takeaways
====================
* vagrant 
 dev environments
 build machines
* consistent dedicated teams - all aligned, staying together (shouldn't change up teams), teams are the resource unit (teams are agile, projects aren't)
* update JVM each release -> automate JVM update (part of the build...?)
* groovey for tests
* grails for build
