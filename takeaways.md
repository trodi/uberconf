actionable takeaways
====================
* vagrant (dev environments, build machines) scripts should be version controlled, replace many docs with scripts
* consistent dedicated teams - all aligned, staying together (shouldn't change up teams), teams are the resource unit (teams are agile, projects aren't)
* grails for build (build should be treated like code)
* update JVM each release -> automate JVM update (part of the build...?)
* groovey for tests
* 
general
-------
* unused complexity/features just provides technical debt
* harvest idiomatic patterns, instead of creating them upfront (those cool very generic impl)
