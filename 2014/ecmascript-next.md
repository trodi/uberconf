# ECMAScript next (6)
* javascript follow similar process as java, js vendors implement the spec
* first time in its history that the lang is actually going to change
* spec is being finalized now, officially going to be released june of 2015
* ES6 is fully compatible with ES5

## ES6
* let - block scope variable (not hoisted) -- should use instead of var
* const - gives you a constant (same semantics as var...)
* default values
* arrow functions
	* let rec = (x,y) => log([x,y])
* destructuring -  [b,a] = [a,b] --- swap in one line
