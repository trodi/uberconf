# getting things done
* problem of work / life -> now is work and life -- no separation
* many input sources

## compress number of inputs
* combine emails/calendars
* use aggregators (rss)
	* feedly
* reduce following on twitter/FB/etc.

----------

* collect
	* combine into a 5 or 6 buckets
	* your mind - keep a small pocket notepad to jot down (paper clip to where you are) -- capture everything!
* process
	* do it, defer it, delegate it, file it, trash it
	* your inboxes are at zero
* organize - what you have to do, what's on your plate
	* TODO list - things that have been deferred -> added to the real todo list
		* email IS NOT a todo list, process it out
	* evernote - filing reference material
	* calendar
		* is sacred - only non-negotiable things
	* trash
	* "inbox zero" - empty out all of your boxes
* do
	* calendar is your hard landscape of your life
	* create a weekly list
	* every day look at that list and create your daily list (3-5 items that *have* to happen, you can always go back and add more after you are done)
	* look at these through the lens of your big rocks
* TODO
	* what - read, call, etc.
	* when
	* who
	* where - @computer, @phone, @errands
	* why (big rocks first, sand, beer story)
	
## big rocks
* 3-5 big rocks
	* work, family, spouse, self, 
	* each one has it's backlog

## review
* you need to have the retrospect to see how everything went
* look at last week before you plan for the next
* EVERY WEEK
