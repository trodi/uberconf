functional thinking
===================
closure does for mutli threading that java did for memory allocation

func in java 8 book, can impl memoization

talk - simple made easy

STM impl - only haskell and closure
many design choices made from memory contrained 30 yr old assumptions

groovy has @Immutable
reuse at function level instead of creating larger data structures (objects)
functional langs can be good candidates for DSL support (closure)
