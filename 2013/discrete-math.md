discrete math you need to know
==============================
deals with ints

### courses
"the great courses" - discrete mathematics (prof has a crazy TED talk)

problems of counting
--------------------
order and repetition

* sequences
** order matters, repetiton allowed
** k^n (k different things, n number of items)
* arrangements
** order matters, repetition is not allowed
** n!/(n-k)!(k different things, n number of items) -> var might be reversed
* subsets
** order doesn't matter, repetition is not allowed
**  "n choose k" (n different types, k number of items) binomial coefficient 
** pascal's triangle ...
*** n!/k!(n-k)!
* multisubsets
** order doesn't matter, repetition is allowed
*** "n multi-choose k" (n types, k number of items)
*** "n+k-1 choose k"

number theory
-------------
* the division theorem
relative-prime
* bezout's identity
* euclid's algorithm

numbers with names
------------------
* even, odd
* prime, composite,
* perfect
* deficient ('less than perfect')
* abundant
* mersenne number ((2^n)-1)
* carmichael numbers

modular arithmetic
------------------
* clocks
* calendars
