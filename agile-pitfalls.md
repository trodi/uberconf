agile pitfalls
==============
lack of a person experienced with agile process
more than just creating a plan and following it (train vs plane)

shouldn't be "mini-waterfall"

pitfalls
--------
* business involvement - the _right_ software
customer as part of the team, should be: available, knowledgeable, empowered
* XP and guidance
provide training vs all learning as you go. needs to be okay to fail (obstacles aren't failures).
* management support
redefining roles, middle management can often trip
* culture
focus needs to move to delivery value, instead of dates. never done improving. should be constantly experimenting/improving.
it's about the _team_ not the _individual_.

avoid cargo cult agile

top 3 critical
--------------
* team velocity - number of things teams can finish in sprint, you can't always go faster, should be associated with steady/planning. can then plan release based on data
* consistent dedicated teams - all aligned, *staying* *together* (shouldn't change up teams), teams are the resource unit (teams are agile, projects aren't)
* one (team) backlog - clears priority, unified effort
